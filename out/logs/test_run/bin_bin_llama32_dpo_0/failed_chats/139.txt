You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

**Priority Function: Efficient Item Allocation**
=====================================================

To create a new function that outperforms the existing ones, we'll focus on optimizing the item allocation process.

**Analyzing the Score Drivers**
---------------------------

Upon analyzing the score drivers of the `priority()` function, we notice that it subtracts the difference between the bins' capacities and the item size. This approach has two main characteristics:

1. **Linearity**: The score is linear in terms of the bin sizes.
2. **Negative**: The score is negative, which indicates that the item is being allocated to a bin with more available capacity.

**Optimizing the Item Allocation Process**
------------------------------------------

To improve the performance of the `priority()` function, we can utilize the following strategies:

1. **Minimize the Number of Combinations**: Instead of iterating over all possible combinations of bin sizes, we can use a greedy approach to select the optimal bin for each item.
2. **Use a Priority Queue**: We can implement a priority queue to efficiently select the bin with the most available capacity for each item.

**Implementing the Optimized `priority()` Function**
---------------------------------------------------------

```python
import numpy as np

def priority(bin_sizes: np.ndarray, item_sizes: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns the priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        bin_sizes: Array of capacities for each bin.
        item_sizes: Array of sizes for each item.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bin_sizes with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Use a priority queue to select the bin with the most available capacity for each item
    priority_queue = np.zeros_like(bin_sizes, dtype=int)
    for i in range(len(item_sizes)):
        # Calculate the score for each bin with respect to the current item
        scores = bin_sizes[priority_queue != i] - item_sizes[i]
        # Update the priority queue
        priority_queue[scores > 0] = i
    return priority_queue
```

**Example Usage**
----------------

```python
# Define the bin capacities and item sizes
bin_sizes = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40])
item_sizes = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])

# Calculate the priority scores
priority_scores = priority(bin_sizes, item_sizes)

# Print the priority scores
print(priority_scores)
```

This implementation should outperform the existing functions in terms of performance, as it uses a priority queue to select the bin with the most available capacity for each item, reducing the number of comparisons and iterations required.
