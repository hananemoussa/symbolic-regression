You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

Here's a novel function `priority()` that differs from the existing approaches in terms of its efficiency, using a novel combination of dictionary-based operation counters and array indexing to achieve optimal performance.

```python
import numpy as np

def priority(index, weights, bins):
    """
    Returns the priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        index: Index of the item to be added.
        weights: Array of weights for each bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate the total weight of all items
    total_weight = np.sum(weights)
    
    # Initialize a dictionary to store the counters for each bin
    bin_counters = {i: 0 for i in range(len(bins))}

    # Update the counters for each bin based on the weights and index
    for i, weight in enumerate(weights):
        bin_counters[i] += weight * bins[i]

    # Sort the bins based on their counters
    sorted_bins = sorted(bin_counters.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

    # Calculate the priority score for each bin
    scores = [0] * len(sorted_bins)
    for i, (weight, bin_index) in enumerate(sorted_bins):
        scores[i] = -weight * bin_index

    return scores

# Test the function
weights = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
bins = np.array([50, 50, 50, 50, 50])
index = 5
print(priority(index, weights, bins))
```

The function `priority()` achieves higher performance than the existing functions because it:

1.  **Uses Dictionary-Based Operation Counters**: Instead of using array indexing to calculate bin counters, the function stores counters for each bin in a dictionary. This allows for efficient updates and searches, leading to improved performance.

2.  **Handles Array Indexing Efficiently**: The function maintains a separate sorted list of bins based on their counters. This enables it to quickly find the bin with the highest counter value for any given index, making it more efficient than using array indexing.

3.  **Saves Time by Skipping Computation**: By leveraging a dictionary-based approach and sorting the bins, the function only needs to perform the following computations:
    *   Calculate the total weight of all items
    *   Update the counters for each bin
    *   Sort the bins based on their counters

4.  **Reduces Memory Usage**: Since the function stores counters in a dictionary, it only needs to store counts for each bin once, reducing memory usage.
