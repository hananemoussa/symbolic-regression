You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

To create a new function, priority(), that outperforms the existing functions, we will analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function, -536.78. The current function takes the capacity of the bin and subtracts the item size, then multiplies by -1 to get the priority score. This means the items are moved out of the bins based on their size, with larger items moving out first.

To achieve better performance, we can use a technique that moves items into bins based on their size in descending order. This approach is often used in heap data structures, where elements are added to a heap based on their size.

Here's an implementation of a priority function based on heap operations:

```python
import numpy as np
from heapq import heappop, heappush

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Create a heap to store bins sorted by capacity in descending order
    bins_heap = np.array(list(bins)).astype(np.float64)  # Convert to float64 for efficient comparison
    # Push bins onto the heap
    for i, bin_capacity in enumerate(bins_heap):
        heappush(bins_heap, (bin_capacity, i))

    # Get the size of the bin with the smallest capacity
    smallest_bin_size = heappop(bins_heap)[0]

    # Find the index of the bin with the smallest capacity
    smallest_bin_index = bins_heap.index((smallest_bin_size, -1))[1]

    # Move the item to the bin with the smallest capacity
    heappush(bins_heap, (item, smallest_bin_index))

    # Get the size of the bin with the new item size
    new_bin_size = heappop(bins_heap)[0]

    # Find the index of the bin with the new smallest capacity
    new_bin_index = bins_heap.index((new_bin_size, -1))[1]

    # Move the item to the bin with the new smallest capacity
    heappush(bins_heap, (item, new_bin_index))

    return bins_heap
```

This implementation works by using a heap to store bins sorted by capacity in descending order. It then moves items from the bins with the largest capacities to the bins with smaller capacities. This approach ensures that items are added to bins in descending order based on their size, resulting in the highest-scoring function.

To calculate the score, we can use a simple formula that multiplies the priority score with the position of the bin being updated:

```python
def calculate_priority(bins, items):
    # Initialize the score array with zeros
    scores = np.zeros(len(bins))

    # Calculate the priority score for each item
    for i, item in enumerate(items):
        scores[i] = priority(item, bins)

    # Return the final scores
    return scores

# Example usage
bins = np.array([2, 4, 6])  # Array of bin capacities
items = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  # Array of item sizes
scores = calculate_priority(bins, items)

# Print the scores
print("Priorities:", scores)
```

This implementation calculates the priorities of items based on the heap operations and returns the final scores. The example usage demonstrates how to use the `calculate_priority` function to calculate the priorities of items and print the results.
