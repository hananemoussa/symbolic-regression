You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

**Priority Function Improved**
=====================================

To improve the performance of the existing functions, we can utilize the concept of integer programming, which can model the problem using linear programming techniques.

The existing approach utilizes a greedy algorithm with a simple threshold-based approach, where we assign a negative value to the difference between the item size and the current bin capacity. However, this approach has limitations, such as it does not guarantee the optimal solution and can lead to suboptimal assignments.

Here's an improved version of the `priority` function that leverages integer programming to find the optimal assignment:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import linprog

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns a priority array where the index of each bin represents the amount of item 
    that should be placed in that bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """

    # Define the objective function
    c = np.full_like(bins, 1.0)  # Coefficients for each bin

    # Define the constraints
    A_ub = np.vstack([np.full((1, bins.shape[1]), -item - bins), np.full((bins.shape[0], bins.shape[1]), -1)]).T
    b_ub = -item  # Negative of item size

    # Solve the linear programming problem
    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A_ub, b_ub=b_ub, method="highs", bounds=(0, bins.shape[1]))

    return -res.fun  # Return the negative of the optimal objective function value
```

This improved function uses linear programming to find the optimal assignment. The `linprog` function from SciPy is used to solve the quadratic programming problem defined by the objective function and the constraints.

**Why it Works**
----------------

This function works by:

1.  Defining the objective function `c` as a column vector where each element represents the score of a bin.
2.  Defining the constraints `A_ub` and `b_ub` as matrices and vectors, respectively, to specify the scoring for each bin.
3.  Solving the linear programming problem using the `linprog` function, which returns the optimal solution.
4.  Negating the objective function value to obtain the final priority array.

**Example Use Case**
--------------------

```python
# Define the item size and bin capacities
item_size = 10.0
bin_capacities = np.array([20.0, 30.0, 40.0])

# Compute the priority scores
scores = priority(item_size, bin_capacities)

# Print the scores
print(scores)
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `priority` function to compute the priority scores for a given item size and bin capacities. The scores represent the amount of item that should be placed in each bin to maximize the total score.
