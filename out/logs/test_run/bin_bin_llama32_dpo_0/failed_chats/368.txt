You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

Here is a new function called `priority()`, which prioritizes items based on their relative importance and the number of bins they belong to:

```python
import numpy as np

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray, weights: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Returns a priority score for each item, based on its importance and the number of bins it belongs to.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.
        weights: Array of weights for each bin, where weights[i] represents the number of bins that item [i] belongs to.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with a priority score for each bin.
    """
    # Calculate the priority score for each item
    scores = -weights / bins + item / np.sum(weights)

    # Normalize the scores to ensure they add up to 1
    scores = scores / np.sum(scores)

    # Map the scores to a binary representation (0 or 1)
    scores = np.where(scores >= 1, 1, 0)

    return scores

# Example usage:
item_sizes = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
bins = np.array([2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0])
weights = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])

priorities = priority(item_sizes, bins, weights)
print(priorities)
```

This new function works by calculating a score for each item based on its size and the number of bins it belongs to. The score is then normalized to ensure it adds up to 1. Finally, the scores are mapped to a binary representation (0 or 1), where 1 indicates the item is a good fit for the bin and 0 indicates it's not. This approach is more effective than the previous function because it considers not only the size of the item but also its relationship to the existing bins. The weighted sum of the item's size with the number of bins it belongs to is more accurate than simply subtracting the size from the bin capacity.
