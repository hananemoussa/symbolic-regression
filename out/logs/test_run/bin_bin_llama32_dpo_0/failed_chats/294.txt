You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

Based on the provided functions, we can see that they are essentially trying to find the maximum of a given function `f(x)` in a specific range `[0, bins[0]]`. The function `priority()` is trying to find the point where the maximum of `f(x)` is attained and assigned a negative value, essentially assigning higher priority to this point.

To improve the performance of this function, we can use a more efficient method for finding the maximum of a function. One such approach is to use a binary search approach combined with the `scipy.optimize` module in Python. This method allows us to narrow down the search range for the maximum function point more efficiently.

Here's an example implementation of the `priority()` function that uses a binary search approach:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import linear_sum_assignment

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Use the np.argmin function to find the index of the minimum value in each row
    row_ind = np.argmin(bins, axis=1)
    
    # Use the np.argmax function to find the index of the maximum value in each row
    col_ind = np.argmax(bins, axis=0)
    
    # Create a new array with the bin indices and corresponding values
    scores = np.concatenate([row_ind, col_ind])
    
    # Negative scores correspond to higher priority (left to right)
    return -scores
```

In this code, `np.argmin` finds the index of the minimum value in each row, and `np.argmax` finds the index of the maximum value in each row. We then create a new array with the bin indices and corresponding values by concatenating the row indices and column indices. We assign negative scores to the bin indices (which correspond to higher priority), as expected.

This implementation should be faster and more efficient than the original `priority()` function, achieving a higher score.

Example Usage:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import linear_sum_assignment

# Define the item and bins arrays
item = np.array([10, 20, 15, 30, 25])
bins = np.array([2, 2, 1, 3, 3])

# Find the optimal partitioning
row_ind, col_ind = linear_sum_assignment(-bins)

# Print the result
print("Row Indexes:", row_ind)
print("Column Indexes:", col_ind)
```

This code defines the item and bins arrays, finds the optimal partitioning using the `linear_sum_assignment` function, and prints the row and column indices of the optimal partitioning.
