You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

Here's a new function `priority()` that uses a greedy strategy to fill bins with items in descending order of their scores:

```python
import numpy as np

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Sort bins in descending order of their remaining capacities
    bins = np.sort(bins)[::-1]
    
    # Initialize an array to store the priority scores
    priority_scores = np.zeros_like(bins)
    
    # Fill the priority scores array by assigning the maximum capacity of each bin
    for i, bin in enumerate(bins):
        priority_scores[i] = bin - item
    
    return priority_scores
```

This new function uses a greedy strategy to fill bins with items in descending order of their scores. It sorts the bins in descending order of their remaining capacities, then iterates over each bin and assigns the maximum capacity of each bin to its corresponding item.

The key insight here is that by filling bins in descending order of their remaining capacities, the function ensures that the items with the highest scores are placed in bins with the smallest remaining capacities, thereby maximizing the score for each bin. This approach is more effective than the original functions because it takes into account the specific characteristics of the score drivers in the original function.

The time complexity of this function is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the number of bins. The space complexity is O(n) as we need to store the sorted bins and the priority scores array.

**Example usage:**

```python
bins = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
item = 30

priority_scores = priority(item, bins)
print(priority_scores)
```

This code will output the priority scores for each bin based on the greedy strategy outlined above.
