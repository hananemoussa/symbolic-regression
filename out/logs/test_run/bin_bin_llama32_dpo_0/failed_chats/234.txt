You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

### Improving the Priority Function
```python
import numpy as np
import scipy.optimize as optimize

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray, bounds=None) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns a vector of priority scores for each bin, indicating the relative size of each bin.

    Args:
        item (float): The size of the item to be added to the bin.
        bins (np.ndarray): An array of capacities for each bin.
        bounds (tuple, optional): Bounds for the item's size. Defaults to None, which means no bounds are applied.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: An array of same size as bins with priority scores of each bin.
    """
    def derivative(f, x, h=1e-7):
        return (f(x + h) - f(x - h)) / (2.0 * h)

    def check_optimality(x):
        return np.all(derivative(priority, x, bounds=bounds), axis=0)

    # Initial guess
    x0 = np.array([1.0, 1.0])  # Start with a simple guess

    # Minimize the sum of absolute differences to find the optimal parameters
    res = optimize.minimize(check_optimality, x0, bounds=bounds)
    return res.x
```

### Key Improvements and Insights
- The new function uses `scipy.optimize.minimize` instead of `scipy.optimize.optimize` to find the minimum of the sum of absolute differences, which is a more efficient approach for this optimization problem.
- The `check_optimality` function checks if the optimal parameters found by `minimize` satisfy the original objective function. This helps ensure the final answer is meaningful.
- The `bounds` parameter is passed to the `priority` function to apply bounds on the item's size. This is crucial for ensuring the algorithm's success.

### Example Usage
```python
import numpy as np

# Define the capacity array
bins = np.array([2, 3, 1, 4, 5])

# Define the item size
item_size = 4.0

# Find the optimal parameters
optimal_parameters = priority(item_size, bins)

# Print the optimal parameters
print(optimal_parameters)
```

### Analyzing the Score Drivers
- The new function minimizes the sum of absolute differences, which represents the cost of adding a given item to each bin.
- By applying bounds to the item's size, the function ensures that the optimal parameters found are reasonable and effective.

### Experimental Variations
- To further improve performance, consider applying constraints on the item size, such as `item_size >= 0` and `item_size <= max(bins)`, to further reduce the number of possible solutions.
- Additionally, you could explore alternative optimization techniques, such as stochastic optimization or gradient-based methods, which might offer improved performance for larger problems.
