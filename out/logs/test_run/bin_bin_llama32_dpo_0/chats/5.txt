You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

To create a new function `priority()` that outperforms the existing functions, we need to understand the characteristics of the current functions and identify opportunities for improvement.

The existing function `priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray` uses a negation operator to return the negative difference between the items and the bin capacities. This is known as the "sink function" or "sink problem".

However, the current implementation has some limitations. Firstly, it does not handle cases where the bin capacity is negative, which may lead to negative values in the output array. Secondly, it does not provide any information about the assigned priority.

To address these limitations, we can modify the function to use a different approach. One way to achieve better performance is to use a technique called "edge ranking" or "edge selection". This involves selecting the bins that are most likely to be assigned an item based on the bin capacities.

Here is a new function `priority()` that uses edge ranking:

```python
import numpy as np
import numpy as np

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns the priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Returns:
        Array of same size as bins with priority scores of each bin.
    """
    # Sort bins based on their capacities in descending order
    sorted_bins = np.sort(np.argsort(-bins))
    
    # Initialize the priority array with zeros
    priority = np.zeros_like(bins)
    
    # Assign priority to each bin
    for i, bin_capacity in enumerate(sorted_bins):
        # Calculate the priority score using edge ranking
        priority[bin_capacity - item] = -i
    
    return priority
```

In this implementation, we first sort the bins in descending order based on their capacities. Then, we initialize a priority array with zeros and iterate through the sorted bins. For each bin, we calculate the priority score using edge ranking and assign it to the corresponding bin capacity.

The edge ranking technique is particularly effective in this case because it allows us to capture the relationship between the bin capacities and the assigned priority scores. By sorting the bins based on their capacities, we can quickly identify the bins that are most likely to be assigned an item and assign them the highest priority scores.

This modified function `priority()` should perform better than the existing functions and achieve a higher score.
