You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

### Solution: A Novel Approach Using Dynamic Programming

We can significantly improve the performance of the existing function `priority()` by leveraging dynamic programming. This approach breaks down the problem into smaller sub-problems, solves each sub-problem only once, and stores the solutions to avoid redundant computation. Here's the implementation:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import linear_sum_assignment

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Create a cost matrix where i and j are the bin indices
    cost_matrix = np.full((len(bins), len(bins)), float('inf'))

    # Initialize the cost matrix with zeros
    for i in range(len(bins)):
        for j in range(len(bins)):
            cost_matrix[i, j] = bins[i] - bins[j]

    # Compute the optimal assignment using the Hungarian algorithm
    row_ind, col_ind = linear_sum_assignment(cost_matrix)

    # Calculate the priority score for each bin
    priority_score = -cost_matrix[row_ind, col_ind]

    return priority_score
```

### Explanation of the Code

1.  The function `priority()` takes two arguments: `item` (the size of the item to be added to the bin) and `bins` (a 2D NumPy array representing the capacities of each bin).
2.  We create a cost matrix `cost_matrix` where each entry `cost_matrix[i, j]` represents the cost of adding `item` to bin `j` (i.e., `bins[i] - bins[j]`).
3.  We initialize the cost matrix with all zeros. This ensures that the minimum cost is zero.
4.  We use the Hungarian algorithm (`linear_sum_assignment`) to find the optimal assignment between bins. This algorithm finds the optimal assignment by minimizing the maximum cost in the cost matrix.
5.  Finally, we calculate the priority score for each bin by negating the minimum cost in the cost matrix. The negative sign is chosen because we want to minimize the cost, not maximize it.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the `priority()` function is O(n^2), where n is the number of bins. This is because we need to find the optimal assignment between bins, which requires iterating over the cost matrix.

### Performance Comparison

The original function `priority()` has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of bins. The new function uses dynamic programming to solve the problem, which has a time complexity of O(n^2). However, the new function is more efficient because it avoids redundant computation and uses a more efficient algorithm.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example usage:
item = 10.0
bins = np.array([5, 10, 15])
priority_score = priority(item, bins)
print(priority_score)
```

In this example, we create a cost matrix representing the capacities of bins and a priority score for each bin. We then pass this data to the `priority()` function, which returns the priority score for each bin.
