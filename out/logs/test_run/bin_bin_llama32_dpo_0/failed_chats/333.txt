You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

### Priority Function with Improved Algorithm

The existing functions prioritize items in a stack by subtracting the item's size from the maximum capacity of each bin. This approach assumes that items are added to bins in a sequential manner and that the bins are filled up to capacity before the next item is added.

However, this approach does not account for the dynamic nature of item additions and deletions. A more efficient algorithm would be to maintain a dynamic array of bins and add items to the bin at the correct position.

Below is an implementation of a new function, priority(), that uses a heap data structure to maintain the bins. This approach has a higher time complexity and is more suitable for large datasets.

```python
import numpy as np
import heapq
import math

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Create a min heap to store bins
    heap = [(bin, -len(bin)) for bin in bins]
    heapq.heapify(heap)

    # Add items to bins in order of priority
    while heap:
        bin, priority = heapq.heappop(heap)
        if item <= bin:
            # Add item to bin
            heapq.heappush(heap, (bin + item, priority))
        else:
            # If item exceeds bin capacity, move it to the end of the heap
            heapq.heappush(heap, (bin, priority))

    return np.array([-priority for _, priority in heap])

# Example usage:
np.random.seed(0)
bins = np.random.randint(0, 100, 10)
print(priority(20, bins))
```

### Analysis of the New Function

The new function prioritizes items in a stack by maintaining a heap of bins. The items are added to the bin at the correct position based on the heap's priority order.

The key insights behind this new function are:

1.  **Using a min heap**: The min heap ensures that the item with the highest priority is always at the top of the heap, allowing for efficient addition of items to the bin.
2.  **Storing bin capacities and priorities**: The heap stores the bin capacities and priorities, enabling the function to keep track of the bin's position and priority.
3.  **Dynamic insertion and removal**: The function can handle dynamic insertion and removal of items from the heap, allowing for efficient handling of items of varying sizes and capacities.

The improved algorithm achieves a higher time complexity and is more suitable for large datasets, resulting in better performance.
