You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

### Priority Function Design

We'll create a function called `priority()` that calculates the priority of adding an item to each bin in a scheduling problem.

#### Insight 1: Use a Hybrid Approach

To beat the existing functions, we can use a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of each function. Here's a possible implementation:

```python
import numpy as np

def idle_time(t):  # Current time in seconds
    """Returns time remaining until the next time slot."""
    return 60 * 5  # assuming 5-minute intervals

def end_time(t):  # Current time in seconds
    """Returns the current time."""
    return t

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate idle time for each bin
    idle_times = (bins - item) / idle_time(end_time(end_time(t)))
    
    # Assign priority score based on idle time
    priority_scores = idle_times * bins
    
    return priority_scores

# Example usage
np.random.seed(42)
t = 10
bins = np.random.randint(10, 30, size=10)  # Capacity range

# Calculate priority scores
scores = priority(t, bins)

# Print the scores
print(scores)
```

#### Explanation

This `priority()` function calculates the priority of adding an item to each bin by first calculating the idle time for each bin based on the remaining capacity and the current time. Then, it assigns a priority score to each bin based on its idle time.

To compare with the existing functions, let's analyze their characteristics:

*   The first function simply subtracts the item size from each bin capacity, resulting in a linear scoring function.
*   The second function subtracts the item size from each bin capacity but assigns a negative score, which likely results in low scores due to the subtraction.

By combining these insights, we can create a hybrid approach that scales well and produces higher scores. The new function uses a time-based scoring system that takes into account the idle time of each bin, resulting in higher scores for bins with lower idle times.

#### Variations

To further improve the function, we can consider the following variations:

*   **Weighted Idle Time:** Assign weights to different types of idle time (e.g., idle due to overfilling, idle due to low capacity) to provide more context-based scoring.
*   **Additional Factors:** Introduce additional factors, such as the time of day or the bin's location, to provide more realistic and diverse scoring.
*   **Optimized Bin Allocation:** Use algorithms like round-robin or slope-based allocation to optimize bin capacity allocation, leading to improved performance.

By exploring these variations, we can create even more effective and innovative solutions that outperform the existing approaches.
