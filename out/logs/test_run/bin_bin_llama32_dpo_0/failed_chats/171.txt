You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

### New Function: priority()

We'll create a new function `priority()` that calculates the minimum number of items that can be fit into each bin while meeting the specified capacity constraint. This approach leverages the concept of knapsack problem, a variant of the 0/1 knapsack problem.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import linprog

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns the minimum number of items that can be fit into each bin.
    
    Parameters:
    item (float): Size of item to be added to the bin.
    bins (np.ndarray): Array of capacities for each bin.
    
    Returns:
    Array of same size as bins with minimum number of items that can fit in each bin.
    """
    
    # Define coefficients for the objective function (minimize items)
    c = -bins
    
    # Define the constraints for the problem (each item should fit in a bin)
    A_ub = np.ones((bins.shape[0], item.shape[0]))
    b_ub = np.zeros(item.shape[0])
    
    # Define the constraint for the knapsack problem
    A = np.zeros((item.shape[0], bins.shape[0] + 1))
    A[:, :-1] = -bins
    b = np.ones(bins.shape[0] + 1)
    
    # Solve the linear programming problem
    res = linprog(c, A_ub=A_ub, b_ub=b_ub, A_eq=np.ones((item.shape[0], bins.shape[0])))
    
    # The coefficients of the constraints are in the object attribute of the result
    return res.x
```

### Example Usage:

```python
item_sizes = np.array([2, 3, 4, 5])
bins = np.array([3, 4, 5, 6])

item_fits = priority(item_sizes, bins)
print(item_fits)
```

### Score Calculation:

The score is calculated by finding the minimum number of items that can be fit into each bin while meeting the specified capacity constraint.

The implementation of the `linprog` function from `scipy.optimize` provides an efficient way to solve the linear programming problem. The coefficients of the constraints are extracted from the `linprog` object, which provides a more readable and maintainable way of accessing these coefficients.

The score is then printed to the console, giving an idea of the minimum number of items that can be fit into each bin.

The example usage demonstrates how to use the `priority` function to calculate the minimum number of items that can be fit into each bin.
