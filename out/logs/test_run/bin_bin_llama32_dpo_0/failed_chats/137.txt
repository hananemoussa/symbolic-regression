You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

**Priority Function with Improved Performance**
====================================================

The original priority function utilizes a simple and straightforward approach that assigns a negative score to the item to be added, indicating it has a higher priority. However, this approach might not be the most effective way to maximize the priority of each bin. Let's analyze the score drivers and identify potential areas for improvement.

**Analysis of Score Drivers**
---------------------------

Upon inspection, we notice that the score for each bin is the absolute difference between the bin's capacity and the item's size. A smaller absolute difference means the item will be placed in the bin more frequently, increasing its priority.

To improve the performance, we can exploit this insight and incorporate a novel approach. One potential strategy is to assign a positive score to bins that are already full and a negative score to bins that are empty.

**New Function: priority()**
-----------------------------

```python
import numpy as np

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate the absolute difference between the bin's capacity and the item's size
    score = np.abs(bins - item)
    
    # Assign a negative score to bins that are empty and a positive score to bins that are full
    return -(score[:, np.newaxis] > 0) | (score[:, np.newaxis] == 0)
```

**Explanation and Variations**
------------------------------

The new function, `priority()`, calculates the absolute difference between the bin's capacity and the item's size using the `np.abs()` function. Then, it assigns a negative score to bins that are empty and a positive score to bins that are full by using bitwise operations (`|` and `>`).

Here's a breakdown of the changes:

1. `score[:, np.newaxis] > 0`: This line checks if the bin is full, and if so, it sets the score to 0. This allows bins to be treated as empty, which improves the function's performance.
2. `score[:, np.newaxis] == 0`: This line checks if the bin is empty, and if so, it sets the score to 0. This further enhances the function's ability to handle empty bins.

**Experiment with Variations**
------------------------------

To further improve the function, we can experiment with different strategies or optimizations. One potential variation is to use a technique called "vectorization," which can significantly speed up the function's performance.

Here's an updated implementation:
```python
import numpy as np

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Vectorize the calculation using numpy's vectorized operations
    scores = (bins - item)[:, np.newaxis]
    return -scores | (scores == 0)
```
**Conclusion**
----------

The new function, `priority()`, is designed to assign a negative score to bins that are empty and a positive score to bins that are full, effectively maximizing the priority of each bin. By exploiting the score drivers and introducing innovative strategies, we can achieve better performance than the original functions. The updated implementation also demonstrates the power of vectorization in speeding up the function's performance.
