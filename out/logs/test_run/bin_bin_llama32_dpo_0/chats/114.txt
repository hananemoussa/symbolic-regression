def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.

# Score achieved with the function above: -536.78


You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

    return -res.fun  # Negate the result to get the original function's score

# Example usage:

print(dynamic_priority(item_sizes, bins))
```

In the code above, we have introduced a new function, `dynamic_priority()`, which employs a dynamic approach to finding the optimal priority function. The function uses the `differential_evolution()` function from SciPy, which is a global optimization method that can find the optimal solution by iteratively perturbing the parameters and checking if the new parameters are better.

The `bounds` parameter is used to define the search space for the parameters. In this case, we use a single bound for all parameters, which means we will start with the same initial guess as the `priority()` function. The `res` variable now holds the best parameters, and we negate the result to get the original function's score.

The example usage demonstrates how to use the `dynamic_priority()` function with a set of item sizes and bins. Note that this function may take a while to converge or may not converge at all, depending on the initial guess and the number of iterations.

The advantage of using this approach is that it can handle complex, non-linear relationships between the item sizes and the bin capacities. However, the implementation may be more computationally intensive and may not always converge to the optimal solution.
