You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

### Priority Function: A Novel Approach

Based on the provided analysis, we can see that the higher-scoring function `priority()` is subtracting the difference between the available bins and the item's size. To achieve better performance, we will implement this approach in a novel way.

```python
import numpy as np

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate the score by subtracting the item size from the bin capacity
    # The min function ensures that each score is never negative
    return np.minimum(-np.ones(bins.shape), bins - item)
```

### Explanation

The key insight behind this approach is to calculate the score directly without explicitly checking if an item fits into a bin. Instead, we simply subtract the item size from the bin capacity and assign the result to the `min` function. This allows us to directly determine the score for each bin, ensuring that each score is always non-negative.

### Variations and Optimizations

To further improve the performance of this function, we can consider the following variations:

*   **Collision detection:** When subtracting the item size from the bin capacity, we need to check for collisions where the remaining capacity is negative. We can use the `numpy argmax` function to find the index of the maximum bin capacity that is less than or equal to the item size, and then use this value to subtract from the item size.
*   **Bin reallocation:** If the item size is larger than the maximum capacity of the current bin, we need to reassign the item to a different bin. We can use the `numpy argmin` function to find the index of the minimum bin capacity that is greater than or equal to the item size, and then use this value to subtract from the item size.
*   **Using `numpy broadcasting:**` Instead of using the `min` function, we can use broadcasting to assign the scores directly to the bins. We can create a matrix of bin capacities and a matrix of item sizes, and then perform element-wise subtraction using the `numpy subtract` function.

```python
import numpy as np

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Create a matrix of bin capacities and item sizes
    bins capacities = np.maximum(bins, item)
    # Perform element-wise subtraction using broadcasting
    return np.subtract(bins, item)
```

By applying these variations and optimizations, we can create a novel function that outperforms the existing approaches and achieves a higher score.
