You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

**Innovative Solution:**

We can create a function called `priority()` that utilizes the concept of gradient descent to optimize the score achieved by each bin. This approach will help in determining the optimal priority for each item.

```python
import numpy as np

def gradient_descent(priority_function, initial_guess, learning_rate, iterations):
    """
    Gradient descent optimization algorithm.

    Args:
        priority_function: Function to optimize (e.g., priority(item, bins)).
        initial_guess: Initial guess for the optimization.
        learning_rate: Step size for the optimization.
        iterations: Number of iterations for the optimization.

    Returns:
        Optimal scores for each bin.
    """
    # Initialize bins with their initial capacities
    bins = np.array([100, 150, 200])  # Example bins with capacities 100, 150, 200
    bin_scores = bins.copy()

    for _ in range(iterations):
        # Compute gradients for each bin
        gradients = np.zeros_like(bins)
        for i in range(len(bins)):
            # Calculate gradient as the difference between the priority function and the actual score
            gradient = (priority_function(item, bins) - bin_scores[i]) / bins[i]
            gradients[i] = gradient

        # Update bin scores using gradient descent
        bin_scores -= learning_rate * gradients

    return bin_scores

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Compute the difference between the actual score and the optimal score
    gradients = -(bins - item) / bins
    return gradients

# Example usage
item_sizes = np.array([50, 60, 70])
bins = np.array([100, 150, 200])

optimal_scores = gradient_descent(priority, initial_guess=np.array([100]), learning_rate=0.1, iterations=1000)
priority_scores = np.zeros_like(bins)
for i, size in enumerate(item_sizes):
    priority_scores += gradient_descent(priority, initial_guess=np.array([100]), learning_rate=0.1, iterations=1000)

print("Gradient Descent Optimal Scores:")
print(optimal_scores)
print("\nPriority Function Scores:")
print(priority_scores)
```

This code implements the `priority()` function using gradient descent optimization. It takes into account the `gradient_descent()` function used to optimize the `priority()` function. The code demonstrates how to use both functions to calculate the optimal priority and the scores achieved with gradient descent and the priority function.
