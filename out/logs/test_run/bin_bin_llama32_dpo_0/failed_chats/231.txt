    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.

You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

Explanation:

1. The function `normalized_tinhtean_loss` calculates the normalized Tinhtean loss, which is a measure of the difference between the predicted score and the true score.
2. The function `safe_division` is a function that performs safe division to avoid division by zero errors.
3. The function `priority` calculates the priority scores for each item based on their size. It first calculates the Tinhtean loss for each item and then adds 1 to the relative losses, which is the Tinhtean loss divided by the item size.
4. The `priority()` function returns an array of priority scores for each item.

This solution uses a more accurate and efficient approach to calculate the priority scores, and avoids division by zero errors by using the `safe_division` function to handle the cases where the item size is zero.

The output of the `priority()` function will be a priority score array for each item, with higher scores indicating that the item is more desirable to add to the bin.
