You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

To create a new function, `priority()`, that outperforms the existing functions and achieves a higher score, we need to understand the characteristics of the existing functions and identify areas for improvement.

Existing Functions:

1. `priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray` - This function uses a simple negative scoring approach, where a higher item size is assigned a lower priority.

2. `Score achieved with the function above: -536.78`

3. `priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray` - This function returns the difference between the current item size and the available capacity in each bin. This approach allows for dynamic priority calculation based on the remaining capacity in each bin.

Analyzing the Score Drivers:

* The existing `priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray` function scores the priority by subtracting the current item size from the available capacity in each bin, which results in a higher score for larger items.
* The `Score achieved with the function above: -536.78` indicates that the score is negative, suggesting a loss.

To create a new function, `priority()`, that outperforms the existing functions and achieves a higher score, we can introduce a new strategy that combines elements of the existing functions. We will use a binary search approach to find the optimal balance between item size and available capacity in each bin.

New Function: `priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray`

```python
import numpy as np

def binary_search(candidates, target):
    """
    Binary search function to find the index of the target value in the list of candidates.
    """
    left, right = 0, len(candidates) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if candidates[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif candidates[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return left

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray, target=None):
    """
    Calculate the priority score for the given item and bins.
    """
    if target is None:
        # Find the index of the target value in the list of bins
        index = binary_search(bins, item)
        return -(bin - item + bins[index])
    else:
        # Find the index of the target value in the list of bins
        index = binary_search(bins, target)
        # Calculate the priority score based on the available capacity
        priority_score = - (bins[index] - target)
        # Calculate the priority score based on the item size
        return priority_score

# Example usage
bins = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
item = 45.0
priority_score = priority(item, bins)
print(priority_score)
```

This new function uses a binary search approach to find the index of the target value in the list of bins. It then calculates the priority score based on the available capacity and item size. The score is negative if the item is larger than the target, and positive if the item is smaller than the target.

This approach ensures that the priority score is calculated in a way that takes into account the dynamic balance between item size and available capacity in each bin. The result should be a higher score than the original functions, which rely on a simple negative scoring approach.
