You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

### Improved Priority Function

To create a new function that outperforms the existing `priority()` function, we need to understand what makes the `priority()` function score higher items. By analyzing the code, we notice that it attempts to minimize the difference between the available capacity and the required item size by subtracting the difference from the capacity. This approach seems reasonable but might not be the most effective strategy.

A better approach is to use a negative difference, which is often referred to as the "perfect indicator". The idea is to assign a lower value to bins that have more capacity available, as it indicates that the bin can hold more items without overloading. On the other hand, bins that have less capacity available should receive higher scores, as they indicate that the bin might not be able to hold as many items.

Here's a Python implementation of the improved `priority()` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate the difference between the available capacity and the required item size
    # for each bin and assign a negative score if the bin has more capacity available
    # and a positive score if the bin has less capacity available
    priority_score = -np.abs(np.maximum(bins - item, 0))
    return priority_score
```

### Example Usage

```python
# Create an array of bin capacities and item sizes
bins = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
item_sizes = np.array([5, 10, 15, 20, 25])

# Calculate the priority score for each item size
priority_scores = priority(item_sizes, bins)

# Print the priority scores
print(priority_scores)
```

This implementation of the `priority()` function assigns a lower value to bins that have more capacity available, as they indicate that the bin can hold more items without overloading. It achieves this by using the `np.abs` function to calculate the absolute difference between the available capacity and the required item size for each bin. The `np.maximum` function is used to ensure that the difference is at least as large as the item size, and a negative score is assigned to bins that have more capacity available.
