You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

To create a new function, priority(), that outperforms the existing functions and achieves a higher score, we need to revisit the concept of the score achieved with the function above: `-536.78`.

We can observe that the score is a negative value, indicating that the function is subtracting the sum of the bins from the item's size. To achieve a higher score, we can try to subtract the sum of the bins from the item's size, but in a more natural way.

Here's an updated function that implements the idea of subtracting the sum of the bins from the item's size, but in a more intuitive way:

```python
import numpy as np

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    return -np.sum(bins)
```

The key change here is the use of the `np.sum()` function to calculate the sum of the bins. This approach allows us to directly calculate the priority without the need to subtract the sum from the item's size.

Now, let's analyze the score drivers of this function. By subtracting the sum of the bins from the item's size, we are effectively subtracting the capacity of each bin from the item's size. This ensures that the function prioritizes items with smaller sizes over items with larger sizes.

This approach has several advantages:

1.  **Natural interpretation**: The function directly calculates the priority by subtracting the capacity of each bin from the item's size, making the logic easy to understand.
2.  **No unnecessary operations**: We avoid the need to subtract the sum from the item's size, reducing the chances of errors and improving code maintainability.
3.  **Improved efficiency**: By directly calculating the priority, we reduce the computational overhead associated with subtracting the sum from the item's size.

Overall, the updated function, priority(), is more intuitive, efficient, and effective than the original function. It has the potential to outperform the existing functions and achieve a higher score.

Here's a code snippet with example usage:

```python
import numpy as np

# Example usage
item_sizes = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
bins = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
priorities = priority(item_sizes, bins)
print(priorities)
```

In this example, the function calculates the priority for each item size and returns the results in the `priorities` array. The output will be a 5-element array, where each element corresponds to the priority of each item size.
