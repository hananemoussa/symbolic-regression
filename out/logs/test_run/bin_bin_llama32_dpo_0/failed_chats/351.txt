You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

### Prioritized Item Distribution Function

The existing function used a simple score approach by subtracting the bin's capacity from the item size and negating the result. This was based on the idea that the bin with the least available capacity would want to hold the item, thus placing a higher priority on it. However, this approach may not always yield the optimal solution, especially when dealing with non-uniform distribution of items across bins.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import linear_sum_assignment

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray, weights: np.ndarray = None) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns the priority with which each item should be added to each bin.

    Args:
    item: The size of the item to be added to the bin.
    bins: The array of capacities for each bin.
    weights: Optional weights for the items to be distributed. Default is None, which means equal weight distribution.

    Returns:
    Array of same size as bins with the weighted priority of each bin.
    """
    if weights is None:
        weights = np.ones(len(bins)) / len(bins)
    
    # Use linear programming to solve the assignment problem
    row_ind, col_ind = linear_sum_assignment(weights - bins)
    return -weights[row_ind]
```

### Experimentation with Variations

The new function uses a linear programming approach to solve the assignment problem. This approach ensures that the item with the highest priority is placed in the bin with the most available capacity.

**Improvements Over the Existing Function**

1.  **Weighted Prioritization**: By using weights, the function allows for non-uniform distribution of items across bins. This means that bins with more available capacity can still prioritize items more than others.
2.  **Optimized Assignment**: The use of linear programming ensures that the optimal solution is found, taking into account the weights and capacities of the bins.
3.  **Direct Calculation**: The function now calculates the priority directly using the weights, eliminating the need for negating the bin's capacity.

### Example Usage

```python
np.random.seed(0)  # Set seed for reproducibility
item_sizes = np.random.uniform(10, 30, size=100)  # Generate random item sizes
bins = np.random.randint(10, 30, size=10)  # Generate random bins

# Prioritized item distribution function
priority_scores = priority(item_sizes, bins)

# Print the priority scores
print("Priority Scores:", priority_scores)
```

This example demonstrates how to use the prioritized item distribution function to calculate the priority scores of items based on their sizes and the availability of bins.
