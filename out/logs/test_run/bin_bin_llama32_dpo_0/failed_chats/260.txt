You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

### Priority Function Based on Minimum Wage System

After analyzing the characteristics of the higher-scoring function, we can identify that it is using a **Minimum Wage System**. This means that the priority score is inversely proportional to the difference between the available capacity and the size of the item. This effectively uses the largest available capacity to pack the item, resulting in a higher score.

### New Function: priority()

```python
import numpy as np

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin based on the minimum wage system.
    
    Args:
        item (float): Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins (np.ndarray): Array of capacities for each bin.
    
    Returns:
        np.ndarray: Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate the minimum capacity required to pack the item
    min_capacity = np.max(bins) - item
    
    # If the item cannot be packed within any capacity, return a large priority score
    if min_capacity == 0:
        return np.full_like(bins, float('inf'))
    
    # The priority score is inversely proportional to the difference between the available capacity and the size of the item
    return -(bins - min_capacity)

# Example usage:
item_sizes = np.random.uniform(1.0, 10.0, 1000)  # Generate 1000 item sizes between 1 and 10
bins_sizes = np.random.uniform(1.0, 100.0, 1000)  # Generate 1000 bins with random sizes between 1 and 100
print(priority(item_sizes, bins_sizes))
```

### Benefits of the New Function:

*   The new function uses a **Minimum Wage System**, which more effectively packs items into bins.
*   The priority score is now calculated based on the minimum capacity required to pack the item, resulting in a higher score.
*   The function returns a large priority score for items that cannot be packed within any capacity, indicating that these items should be added to the bins immediately.

### Note:

*   This function assumes that the input data (item sizes and bins sizes) follows a normal distribution. If the data is not normally distributed, the function may not provide accurate results.
*   The function uses a simple calculation to determine the priority score, which may not be optimal for all cases. More complex calculations or optimizations may be necessary for certain applications.
