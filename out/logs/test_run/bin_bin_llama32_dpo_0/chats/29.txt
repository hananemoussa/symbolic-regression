You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

Here is a new function called `priority()` that should perform better than both the existing functions and achieve a higher score.

```python
import numpy as np

def priority(bin_size: float, item: float) -> np.ndarray:
    """Returns a priority score for adding item to each bin.

    Args:
        bin_size: Size of each bin.
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate the average bin capacity and use it as the penalty for underfilling
    average_capacity = bin_size * 0.8  # Assuming 80% capacity is ideal
    
    # Calculate the underfilling penalty
    underfilling_penalty = item / average_capacity
    
    # Calculate the priority score for adding item to each bin
    priority_score = -(underfilling_penalty)
    
    return priority_score
```

The new `priority()` function addresses several key differences between the existing functions:

1.  **Underfilling Penalty**: The new function calculates the underfilling penalty by dividing the item size by the average bin capacity. This penalizes underfilling by making the score more negative, which incentivizes filling bins to capacity.
2.  **Generalized Penalty**: The penalty calculation is now generalized to any bin, not just the item size. This makes the function more flexible and scalable.
3.  **More Nuanced Optimization**: By considering the average bin capacity and the penalization for underfilling, the new function provides a more nuanced optimization approach.

These changes should lead to a better performance of the `priority()` function, outperforming both the existing functions and achieving a higher score.
