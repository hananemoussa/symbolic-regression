You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

Here's a new function, `priority()` that uses a more effective strategy to achieve higher scores.

```python
import numpy as np

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Sort bins in descending order of capacity and then by size
    sorted_bins = np.sort(bins)[::-1]
    sorted_bins = np.insert(sorted_bins, 0, 0)  # Add 0 to represent empty bins

    # Calculate priority for each bin
    priority = -np.sort(bins)[::-1].sum()  # Sum the scores in descending order

    # Distribute the item to the bins with the highest priority
    distribution = np.split(priority, sorted_bins)

    return distribution
```

The key insights that led to this new function are:

1.  Sorting the bins in descending order of capacity and then by size helps in prioritizing the bins with the largest capacities first, which often leads to better performance.
2.  Using a single line to calculate the priority score in descending order helps to reduce the number of operations required.

Experimentation with Variations:

```python
def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Sort bins in descending order of capacity
    sorted_bins = np.sort(bins)[::-1]

    # Use a simple assignment to calculate priority for each bin
    priority = sorted_bins * item

    return priority
```

These variations aim to simplify the calculation and distribution of items to the bins with the highest priority, potentially leading to better performance.
