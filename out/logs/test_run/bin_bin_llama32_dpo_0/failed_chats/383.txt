You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

To improve the performance of the existing functions, we can use the `scipy.optimize.minimize` function to minimize the sum of absolute differences between the actual capacity and the desired capacity. Here's a new function that implements this approach:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    def objective(x):
        return -np.sum(x) + np.abs(x - item)

    # Use minimize to find the optimal values
    res = minimize(objective, [0.0] * len(bins), method="SLSQP")

    # Map the optimized values to the desired bins
    bins = np.append(bins, res.x)

    return bins
```

In this function, we define an objective function `objective` that represents the sum of absolute differences between the actual capacity and the desired capacity for each bin. We then use the `minimize` function from SciPy to find the optimal values of `x` that minimize this objective function. The `SLSQP` method is chosen because it uses simultaneous constraints (capacity limits) and quadratic programming, which can handle non-convex cases.

The result of the `minimize` function is the array `res.x` containing the optimized values, which represent the priority score for each bin.

Note that this function assumes that the input `item` and `bins` are valid (i.e., positive numbers). If they may not be, you should add error checking code to handle these cases.
