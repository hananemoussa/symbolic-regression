You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

**New Function: priority()**
```python
import numpy as np

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray, lambd: float = 1.5) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.
        lambd: Lambda parameter to control the trade-off between energy and structure. Defaults to 1.5.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate the energy at each bin as the negative of the bin's capacity minus the item's size
    energy = -(bins - item)
    
    # Scale the energy by the lambda parameter to balance energy and structure
    scaled_energy = lambd * energy
    
    # Add the scaled energy to each bin's capacity to get the priority score
    priority_score = bins + scaled_energy
    
    return priority_score
```

**Analysis of Higher-Scoring Function**
The new function prioritizes the scaling of the energy at each bin by the lambda parameter. This is done to balance the energy and structure of the system. The energy represents the "good" of a bin, and scaling it by the lambda parameter controls how much "good" the system wants to prioritize at each bin.

**Experiment with Variations**
To experiment with variations, we can change the lambda parameter to explore different trade-offs between energy and structure. This could be useful in applications where the goal is to optimize the trade-off between different properties of the system.

For example, increasing the lambda parameter could lead to a more energy-focused system, where the most abundant bin is at the top priority. Decreasing the lambda parameter could lead to a more structure-focused system, where the most abundant bin is at the bottom priority.

**Code Example**
```python
import numpy as np

# Lower-scoring function
def lower_priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    return -(bins - item)

# Middle-scoring function
def middle_priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray, lambd: float = 1.5) -> np.ndarray:
    energy = -(bins - item)
    scaled_energy = lambd * energy
    priority_score = bins + scaled_energy
    return priority_score

# Higher-scoring function
def high_priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray, lambd: float = 2.0) -> np.ndarray:
    energy = -(bins - item)
    scaled_energy = lambd * energy
    priority_score = bins + scaled_energy
    return priority_score

# Test the functions
item_size = 10.0
bins = np.array([20.0, 30.0, 40.0])

lower_priority_score = lower_priority(item_size, bins)
middle_priority_score = middle_priority(item_size, bins, lambd=1.5)
high_priority_score = high_priority(item_size, bins, lambd=2.0)

print("Lower priority:", lower_priority_score)
print("Middle priority:", middle_priority_score)
print("High priority:", high_priority_score)
```

This code example demonstrates the usage of the higher-scoring function `high_priority()` and compares its performance with the lower-scoring function `lower_priority()` and the middle-scoring function `middle_priority()`.
