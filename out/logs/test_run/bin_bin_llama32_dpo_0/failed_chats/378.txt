You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

To create a new function that outperforms the existing functions, we can use the concept of graph theory. Here's a new function, `priority()`, that leverages this idea:

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx
from scipy.optimize import linear_sum_assignment

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Create a graph where each bin is a node, and the edges represent the upper bounds
    G = nx.Graph()
    
    for i, bin in enumerate(bins):
        G.add_node(bin, capacity=bin)
    
    # Add edges from each item to its corresponding bin with an upper bound of -item
    for i, item in enumerate(item):
        for j, bin in enumerate(bins):
            if item <= bin:
                G.add_edge(item, bin, weight=bin - item)
    
    # Use the Hungarian algorithm to find the optimal assignment
    row_ind, col_ind = linear_sum_assignment(G.edges(data=True, key=lambda x: x[2]))
    
    # Calculate the scores of each bin based on the edges
    scores = np.zeros_like(bins)
    for i, j in zip(col_ind, row_ind):
        scores[i] = G.get_edge_data(j, i)['weight']
    
    return scores
```

In this implementation, we create a graph where each bin is a node, and the edges represent the upper bounds of the bins. We then add edges from each item to its corresponding bin with an upper bound of `-item`. The Hungarian algorithm is used to find the optimal assignment between the items and the bins, which corresponds to the scores of each bin.

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. We create a graph `G` where each bin is a node, and the edges represent the upper bounds of the bins.
2. We add edges from each item to its corresponding bin with an upper bound of `-item`.
3. We use the Hungarian algorithm to find the optimal assignment between the items and the bins.
4. We calculate the scores of each bin based on the edges.

The `priority()` function returns an array of scores, where the score of each bin corresponds to the edges in the graph.

You can test the `priority()` function with an example like this:

```python
np.random.seed(0)
item = np.random.uniform(0, 100)
bins = np.random.uniform(0, 100, 5)

scores = priority(item, bins)
print(scores)
```

This will output the scores of each bin based on the graph and the Hungarian algorithm.
