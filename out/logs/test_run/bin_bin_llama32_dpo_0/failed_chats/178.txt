You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

Here's a new function, priority(), that builds upon the previous ideas but introduces innovative variations:

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Calculate priority for each bin based on item size and capacity difference.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Returns:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate the maximum capacity and the remaining capacity of the bins
    max_capacity = np.max(bins)
    remaining_capacity = max_capacity - item

    # Calculate the priority for each bin by subtracting the remaining capacity from the maximum capacity
    # This gives a score of 0 if the item fits entirely in the bin, and a negative score if the item does not fit
    priority = np.where(remaining_capacity < 0, bins - remaining_capacity, -(bins - remaining_capacity))

    return priority
```

Now, let's analyze the characteristics of the new function and identify what it does differently or more effectively than the previous functions:

1. **Using `np.where()`**: Instead of directly comparing the remaining capacity to 0, we use `np.where()` to create an array with values less than 0 for the bins that do not fit the item, and values greater than 0 for the bins that do fit.

2. **Simplifying the comparison**: By using `np.where()` instead of directly subtracting, we avoid the complexity of checking if the remaining capacity is less than 0, and then returning a value based on the result. This simplifies the logic and makes the code easier to understand.

3. **Avoiding `numpy` array indexing**: In the previous function, we used `-bins + item` to calculate the priority. In the new function, we use `np.where()` directly to return the priority for each bin.

4. **Preserving the original condition**: We maintain the original condition `-(bins - item)` to ensure that bins that fit the item get a negative priority score, and bins that do not fit the item get a positive one.

Now, let's experiment with variations:

```python
import numpy as np

def test_priority(bins):
    item = 10.0
    scores = calculate_priority(item, bins)
    print(scores)

# Test the function with a list of bins
np.random.seed(42)
bins = np.random.randint(10, 100, size=10)
test_priority(bins)
```

This code generates a random list of bins and prints their priorities. You can modify the function to suit your specific use case.

Here is the same example but with a list of bins:

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_priority(bins):
    """
    Calculate priority for each bin based on item size and capacity difference.

    Args:
        bins: List of capacities for each bin.

    Returns:
        List of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate the maximum capacity and the remaining capacity of the bins
    max_capacity = max(bin for bin in bins)
    remaining_capacity = max_capacity - sum(bin for bin in bins)

    # Calculate the priority for each bin by subtracting the remaining capacity from the maximum capacity
    # This gives a score of 0 if the item fits entirely in the bin, and a negative score if the item does not fit
    priority = np.where(remaining_capacity < 0, bins - remaining_capacity, -(bins - remaining_capacity))

    return priority

# Generate a list of 10 random bins between 10 and 100
bins = np.random.randint(10, 100, size=10)
print(calculate_priority(bins))
```

This code generates a list of random bins and prints their priorities.
