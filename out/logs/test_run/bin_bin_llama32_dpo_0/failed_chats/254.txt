You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

```

This version of the `priority` function uses a more robust strategy by considering equal weighting across bins. It also uses the `sort` method to sort the bins in ascending order before calculating the scores, which ensures that items are placed in the bin with the smallest capacity.

The alternative two functions use the greedy algorithm, which simply places each item in the first bin that has enough capacity. This approach can be better in some cases, but in this specific example, it results in a lower score.
