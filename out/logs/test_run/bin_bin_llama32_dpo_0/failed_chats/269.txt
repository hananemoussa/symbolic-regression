You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

### New Function: priority()
We will create a new function priority() that implements a variant of the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm. The algorithm starts with the smallest bin and always selects the next item with the smallest difference in capacity from the current bin.

```python
import numpy as np
import heapq

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    
    # Initialize the priority score of the first bin to 0
    priority_scores = np.zeros_like(bins)
    priority_scores[0] = 0
    
    # Use a priority queue to store bins to be processed
    priority_queue = [(-item, 0)]  # Each element is a tuple (item, bin, priority_score)
    
    # Process bins in top priority order
    while priority_queue:
        # Pop the bin with the smallest priority score
        _, current_bin, current_score = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)
        
        # If the item added is less than or equal to the current bin, 
        # return the current priority score
        if current_score + item <= -bins[current_bin]:
            return priority_scores
        
        # If the item added is greater than the current bin, 
        # add the next item with the smallest difference in capacity to the priority queue
        next_item = bins[current_bin] + item
        heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (-next_item, current_bin, current_score + item))
```

### Example Usage:
```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array of capacities for bins
bins = np.array([10, 20, 30])

# Define the item size
item_size = 5.0

# Calculate the priority score for each bin
priority_scores = priority(item_size, bins)

# Print the priority scores
print(priority_scores)
```

This function uses a priority queue to efficiently process bins in top priority order. The priority queue is implemented using the `heapq` module in Python, which provides an efficient way to store and manipulate elements based on their priority.
