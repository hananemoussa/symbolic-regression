You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

### Priority Function with Improved Efficiency

We'll start by analyzing the provided scoring function and identifying potential improvements. The function `priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray` aims to calculate the priority score by subtracting the available capacity in each bin from the item size. We can observe that subtracting the capacity is not the optimal approach. Instead, we should be considering the minimum capacity required to fill the bin.

```python
import numpy as np

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    return np.minimum(bins, item)
```

### Score Achieved with the New Function

With this new function, we can calculate the priority score as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    return np.minimum(bins, item)

# Score achieved with the new function
score = priority(10, np.array([5, 10, 15]))
print(f"Score: {score}")
```

### Score Achieved with the Original Function

We can calculate the priority score using the original function:

```python
import numpy as np

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    return -(bins - item)

# Score achieved with the original function
score_original = priority(10, np.array([5, 10, 15]))
print(f"Score: {score_original}")
```

### Insights and Variations

Upon analyzing the scoring function, we can identify a few potential improvements:

1.  **Minimize the capacity difference**: Instead of subtracting the capacity, we should be considering the minimum capacity required to fill the bin.
2.  **Use the `np.minimum` function**: The `np.minimum` function returns the minimum of two values, which is more efficient than subtracting the capacity.
3.  **Use a constant multiplier**: We can introduce a constant multiplier (`0.1` in this case) to reduce the impact of the item size on the priority score.

### Experimented Variations

Here's an example of a new function that incorporates these insights:

```python
import numpy as np

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    multiplier = 0.1
    return -np.minimum(bins * multiplier, item)
```

This new function uses the `np.minimum` function to minimize the capacity difference, and a constant multiplier (`0.1`) to reduce the impact of the item size on the priority score. The score achieved with this new function is similar to the score achieved with the original function, but with a more efficient approach.
