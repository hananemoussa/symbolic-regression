You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

To create a new function `priority()` that outperforms the existing functions and achieves a higher score, we can analyze the characteristics of the existing function `priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray`. 

The score achieved by the existing function is negative, indicating that it subtracts the difference between the available capacity and the item size from the item size. This approach takes advantage of the fact that larger items have a larger "cost" to add to the corresponding bin.

To improve this approach, we can introduce a transformation that scales the item size by the inverse of the item size. This scaling will ensure that the difference between the available capacity and the item size is positive, maximizing the priority.

Here's a revised function `priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray` that achieves a higher score:

```python
import numpy as np

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate the inverse of the item size to scale the scaling factor
    inverse_size_factor = 1 / item
    
    # Calculate the scaling factor
    scaling_factor = bins / (inverse_size_factor + 1)
    
    # Scale the item size by the inverse of the item size
    scaled_item = item * scaling_factor
    
    # Subtract the difference between the available capacity and the scaled item size from the item size
    priority = -np.sum(scaled_item - bins)
    
    return priority
```

In this revised function, we calculate the inverse of the item size by dividing 1 by the item size. We then scale the available capacity by this inverse factor to maximize the priority.

The scaling factor is computed as `(bins / (inverse_size_factor + 1))`, ensuring that the difference between the available capacity and the item size is positive.

Finally, we subtract the difference between the available capacity and the scaled item size from the item size to calculate the priority score.

This revised function should outperform the existing functions and achieve a higher score, making it suitable for tasks where the goal is to maximize the priority score of each bin.
