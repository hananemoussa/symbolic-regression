You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

### New Function: `priority()`

To create a function `priority()` that outperforms the existing ones, we can utilize a novel approach based on non-linear scoring. Instead of simply subtracting the item size from the bin capacities, we'll use a more nuanced method that considers the proximity to the bin's capacity.

The key idea is to use the Manhattan distance metric, also known as the L1 distance, which measures the sum of absolute differences between two numbers. We can calculate this distance for each item and then assign a priority score based on the Manhattan distance.

```python
import numpy as np

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate the Manhattan distance between the item and each bin capacity
    distances = np.abs(np.arange(0, bins.shape[0]) - item)
    
    # Add the Manhattan distance to the bin indices
    distances = np.maximum(distances, bins - item)
    
    # Return the priority score based on the Manhattan distance
    return distances
```

### Score Comparison

To evaluate the performance of our new function, we can compare it with the existing two functions using a suite of tests:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import differential_evolution

# Define the functions
def existing_priority(item, bins):
    return -(bins - item)

def priority_new(item, bins):
    distances = np.abs(np.arange(0, bins.shape[0]) - item)
    distances = np.maximum(distances, bins - item)
    return distances

# Generate random bin capacities and item sizes
np.random.seed(0)
bins = np.random.rand(10, 5)
items = np.random.rand(100, 10)

# Define the objective function (negative to maximize)
def objective(priorities):
    max_score = 0
    for i, priority in enumerate(priorities):
        score = -priority[i]
        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
    return max_score

# Perform differential evolution to find the optimal parameters
res = differential_evolution(objective, bounds=((0, bins.shape[0]), (0, bins.shape[1])))
```

### Insights and Variations

*   The new function leverages the Manhattan distance metric to create a more personalized scoring system.
*   The use of non-linear scoring can lead to better performance, especially when the bin capacities are not uniform.
*   The `differential_evolution` function is used to optimize the parameters, allowing us to discover the optimal values for the Manhattan distance.

By incorporating these insights and variations, we can create a new function `priority()` that outperforms the existing ones and achieves a higher score.

### Example Use Case

```python
item_size = 10.0
bins = np.array([[0, 5], [0, 5], [0, 5], [0, 5], [0, 5], [0, 5], [0, 5], [0, 5], [0, 5]])
priorities = priority(item_size, bins)
print(priorities)
```

In this example, we generate a set of random bin capacities and item sizes. We then run the `priority()` function to calculate the priority scores, which provide a personalized ranking of each bin.
