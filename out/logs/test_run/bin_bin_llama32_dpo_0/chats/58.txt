You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

## New Function: priority()
The existing function, `priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray`, uses the [-bins + item] formula to calculate the priority of each bin. However, this formula has some limitations.

The existing function will return an array where the element at index i is the negative difference between the array `bins` and `item`. This might not be the most efficient way to calculate priority.

To improve the function and achieve a higher score, we can use a technique called " Penalization with Marginal Reuse". This involves adjusting the formula to give more weight to smaller bins and penalizing larger bins.

### Updated Function:
```python
import numpy as np

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate the priority with a marginal increase in item size
    weights = np.log(bins / (item + 1e-10))  # Avoid division by zero
    return -weights
```

### Insights:
1. The `np.log` function is used to calculate the natural logarithm, which is the logarithm to the base e. This allows us to keep the formula logarithmic, which can be more efficient for large bins.
2. The `item + 1e-10` term is used to avoid division by zero when calculating the priority. This is a common technique in optimization problems to prevent division by zero errors.

### Variations:
To further improve the function, we can introduce more innovations, such as:

* Using a more sophisticated formula, like the "Mean Square Error" (MSE) or the "Mean Absolute Error" (MAE) rule.
* Incorporating additional information, such as the "Average Size" of each bin.
* Using more advanced optimization techniques, like gradient-based methods or dynamic programming.

### Example Usage:
```python
import numpy as np

# Create some sample bins
bins = np.array([10, 20, 30])

# Create some sample items
item = np.array([5, 10, 15])

# Calculate priority with marginal reuse
priority_scores = priority(item, bins)
print(priority_scores)

# Calculate priority using MSE
mse_scores = np.mean(np.square(priority(item, bins) - np.mean(priority(item, bins))))
print(mse_scores)
```

In this example, we calculate the priority scores using both the marginal reuse rule and the Mean Square Error (MSE) rule. The MSE rule tends to give better results in many cases, but it requires more computational resources to calculate the average size of each bin and the mean of the priority scores.
