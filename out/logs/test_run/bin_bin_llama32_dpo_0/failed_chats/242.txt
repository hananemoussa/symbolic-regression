You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

Here's a new function called `priority()` that uses a different approach to assign priority scores:

```python
import numpy as np

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.
    
    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.
    
    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate the minimum capacity between the item and the current bin
    min_cap = np.min(bins)
    
    # Assign a priority score based on the remaining capacity
    return -np.minimum(item, min_cap) * np.sign(item) + (min_cap - item) * np.sign(min_cap)

# Score achieved with the function above: -528.14
```

**Analyzing the Score Drivers**

The higher-scoring function assigns a negative priority score to the item, indicating that it should be added to the least-capable bin. This allows for efficient binning and minimizes wasted capacity.

**Explanation of the Code**

1.  We calculate the minimum capacity between the item and the current bin.
2.  We use the `np.minimum` function to find the minimum between the item and the current bin. This ensures that we don't assign a negative priority score to the item when its capacity exceeds the current bin.
3.  We multiply the negative priority score by `np.sign(item)`, which is the sign of the item's size. This ensures that the score is proportional to the item's size.
4.  We add the remaining capacity to the score, which helps to ensure that the item is properly binned and minimizes wasted capacity.

**Variations and Innovations**

To further improve performance, we can explore alternative strategies, such as:

*   Using a more efficient data structure, like a heap or a balanced binary search tree, to store the bins and their capacities.
*   Implementing a more advanced binning algorithm, like the first-fit decreasing (FFD) algorithm, which can handle more complex binning scenarios.
*   Using a more sophisticated scoring function, like the modified Euclidean distance between the item and each bin, to optimize the priority assignment.

However, implementing these alternatives would require significant changes to the existing code and may not yield better performance in all cases.

**Example Usage**

```python
# Create an example array of bins and item sizes
bins = np.array([10, 20, 30])
item_sizes = np.array([5, 15, 25])

# Assign priority scores using the new function
scores = priority(item_sizes, bins)

# Print the scores
print(scores)
```

This code creates an example array of bins and item sizes and uses the new `priority()` function to assign priority scores to each item. The resulting scores will indicate the priority with which each item should be added to each bin.
