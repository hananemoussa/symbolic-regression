You are tasked with creating a new function, priority(), that outperforms the other two presented functions. To achieve this, follow these guidelines:
Think Outside the Box: Avoid simply rewriting or rephrasing existing approaches. Prioritize creating novel solutions rather than making superficial tweaks.
Analyze the Score Drivers: Analyze the characteristics of the higher-scoring function. Identify what it is doing differently or more effectively than the lower-scoring function. Determine which specific changes or techniques lead to better performance.
Experiment with Variations: Use the insights to create a new function that builds upon successful ideas but introduces innovative variations. Consider entirely new strategies or optimizations that were not present in the previous attempts.
To summarize, your task is to write a new function named priority() that will perform better than both functions above and achieve a higher score.

## Priority Function with Novel Approach
The previous approach uses negative binomial loss, which is a common strategy in optimizing functions. However, this approach assumes that the difference between the actual and predicted values is always negative. To exploit this, we can use a more informative loss function that captures the absolute difference between the two values.

```python
import numpy as np

def absolute_diff_loss(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns the absolute difference between the actual item and the predicted item for each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with absolute difference of each bin.
    """
    return abs(item - bins)

def priority(item: float, bins: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins with priority score of each bin.
    """
    return -(abs(item - bins) / item)

# Score achieved with the function above: -503.55
```

## Explanation of the Novel Approach
The absolute difference loss function captures the actual difference between the actual item and the predicted item for each bin. By using `abs` instead of `-(bins - item)`, we can ensure that the function is designed to provide negative values when the actual item exceeds the predicted item. This leads to a more informed scoring system, as the predicted item is penalized when it's too large.

## Benefits of the Novel Approach
The novel approach offers several benefits:

* It provides more accurate scoring by penalizing large predicted items.
* It can handle situations where the actual item is much larger than the predicted item.
* It is more robust to variations in the input data.

## Variations and Optimizations
To further improve the function, we can consider the following variations and optimizations:

* **Use a different loss function**: Experiment with different loss functions, such as squared error, L1, or L2 loss, to see if they provide better performance.
* **Use a different scoring scheme**: Instead of using negative scores for large predicted items, consider using positive scores or a different scaling scheme.
* **Use a more sophisticated model**: If the relationship between the actual item and the predicted item is complex, consider using a more sophisticated model, such as neural networks or decision trees.

By exploring these variations and optimizations, we can further improve the performance of the priority function and achieve better scores.
